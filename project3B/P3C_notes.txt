ummmmm so. Thigns could get broken down into components rather than having everything justifyout here like it is. 
Thats the point of react, right? ok, so components:
app is a box. 
    app breaks down into
    - form component
    - success page component
    - card container is one component that updates onChange from props passed in through form component
