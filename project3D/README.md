# Project 3D

## Exercise:

In this project, you will host your app on AWS.

You should be able to:
- Access the API via the server URL
- Use the front end app normally
- Deploy changes made to the code to the server
- Use the database if at all applicable

## Deployment:

You will:
- Access the AWS account provided to you
- Create a new RDS database
- Create an EC2 instance (t2.micro)
- Access the EC2 instance via SSH
- Upload the code and start the server

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. 

## Notes:
As soon as you have set the server up and it is running properly, inform us. If everything is done properly, perfect. The server will be taken down and moved to a different platform for cost purposes, and it will then be able to be used by you for your portfolios.

*Happy DevOping!*
